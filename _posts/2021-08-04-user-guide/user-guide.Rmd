[1] Switch the heatmap to show credit card or loyalty card in chart A. <br>
[2] Select one or multiple credit/loyalty card number to transactions of specific cards for chart A, B and C. <br>
[3] Select all weekday/weekend or particular dates to filter transactions in specific days for chart A, B, C.

[5] Drag and drop on plot area to zoom in on chart C and see details clearly of boxes. Double-click on plot area to restore the default scale of the plotting.

# 3. GPS

This panel is designed to visualize the GPS tracking data. Two sub-tabs constitute this panel.

**In the first sub-tab:**

![](img/t2.1-1.jpg){width=100%} <br> <p style="text-align:center;"> _Fig.5 The first sub-tab of the panel for GPS_ </p>
[6] Select particular car ID and date(s) to show GPS movement path for selected car in selected date(s) in chart D and E. <br>
[7] The table shows which timeslot each color represents in chart E, and the layer names of the respective timeslots. <br>
[8] This buttons are used to zoom in our zoom out the map for displaying more details.

<p style="text-align:center;"> ![](img/t2.1-2.jpg){width=60%} <br> _Fig.6 Legend and tooltip of chart D_ </p>

[9] The legend of chart D shows which day each color represents. <br>
[10] Click on the movement line to see the tooltip indicating on which day this action occurred in January.

<p style="text-align:center;"> ![](img/t2.1-3.jpg){width=60%} <br> _Fig.7 The layers of timeslot in chart E_ </p>

[11] Hover the cursor over the layer logo on the upper-left corner to see the layers of Chart E. Check or uncheck particular layers by clicking to see the movement of specific timeslots in selected day. 


_\*Tips: In order to better analysis the movement path, highly recommend to select one car ID to overview all movement lines, then further select one date to observe actions in different timeslots of a day._

**In the second tab:**

![](img/df_t2.2hm.jpg){width=100%} <br> <p style="text-align:center;"> _Fig.8 The second sub-tab of the panel for GPS_ </p>
[12] Check or uncheck weekday or weekend to filter GPS track data in weekday or weekend only for chart F.

<p style="text-align:center;"> ![](img/t2-2.jpg){width=50%} <br> _Fig.9 Tooltip in chart F_ </p>

[13] Hover cursor over plot area of chart F to see the tooltip with car ID, hour and record count of each car in one hour.

_\*Note: As the Memory limitation of free Shiny App server, after deploying, the Shiny APP can't afford displaying GPS movement lines for all cars. Thus we filtered GPS tracking data and retained several typical car IDs data to generate the key movement lines for further exploration and analysis._

# 4. Owner Matching

This panel is used to show the relationship between particular car owner and credit/loyalty card holder.

[16] Switch the heatmap to show credit card or loyalty card in chart H.

_\*Note: As stated in section 3, only GPS tracking data of the retained car IDs can be used to build Chart G._
